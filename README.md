# Stock Price Prediction Website üìà:
* This project is a Stock Price Prediction Website built with Python. It uses Streamlit to provide a simple and interactive web interface, and a Machine Learning model implemented in TensorFlow to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

# Built With üõ†Ô∏è
Python 3.x

Streamlit ‚Äì for the web app interface

TensorFlow ‚Äì for building and training the ML model

Pandas ‚Äì data manipulation

NumPy ‚Äì numerical computations

Matplotlib / Plotly ‚Äì data visualization

Other standard Python libraries as needed

# About the LSTM Algorithm :
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed specifically for learning from sequential or time-series data.

Unlike traditional neural networks, which treat all inputs as independent, LSTMs can "remember" information over time. This makes them highly effective for predicting future values based on past trends‚Äîperfect for stock price prediction.
